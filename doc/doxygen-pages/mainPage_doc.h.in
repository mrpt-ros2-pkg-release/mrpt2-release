## About

This is the home of the MRPT C++ library documentation generated by Doxygen. 
See: 
* The [CHANGELOG](changelog.html) for this version.
* Complete list of classes [here](annotated.html).
* [List of libraries and modules](modules.html).

This reference documentation is complementary to:
* [Collection of MRPT tutorials](https://www.mrpt.org/Tutorials/)
* [The MRPT book](https://www.mrpt.org/tutorials/the-mrpt-book/) (out-dated!)

[This page](https://www.mrpt.org/Libraries_tree_layout) explains the library directory layout.

## Dependencies

Check out <a href="dependencies.html" >this page</a> to find out what are needed for each of the MRPT build dependencies (opencv, wxWidgets,...) 
to decide if you need them for your applications.

## Performance benchmarks

Extensive performance tests are automated by means of the application `mrpt-performance`, which was moved (2018) 
to [its own Git repository](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt-performance-tests).

The results on different platforms, as well as a comparison between different 
compilers and platforms are published here: https://performance.mrpt.org/
